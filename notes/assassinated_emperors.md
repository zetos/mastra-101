# Assassinated Emperors (Global, Best-Effort List)

> Note: This list is organized by culture/imperial tradition and is **not yet exhaustive**. It’s intended as a structured starting point. “Assassinated” here generally means deliberately killed by plotters (court factions, palace coups, military conspirators, etc.), not deaths in open battle.

## 3. Japanese Emperors (Tennō)

  - **Cause:** Drowned at the Battle of Dan-no-ura; death is war-related, not a palace assassination, but is sometimes discussed in the context of violent imperial deaths.

*(Most later emperors died naturally or were forced to abdicate rather than murdered; expand with scholarship on doubtful cases.)*

*(Research needed; many Mughal princes were killed, but reigning emperors usually died of illness/old age.)*

---

### Ethiopian Emperors
- **Emperor Tewodros II (r. 1855–1868)**  
  - **Death:** 1868  
  - **Cause:** Shot himself to avoid capture at the Battle of Magdala (suicide under duress, not assassination).
*(Add clear assassination cases if identified in focused Ethiopian imperial histories.)*

### Vietnamese Emperors
*(Several emperors of Đại Việt and Nguyễn may have been poisoned or killed by court factions. Needs dynasty-by-dynasty research.)*

### Korean Monarchs with Imperial Claims
- **Emperor Gojong of Korea (r. 1864–1907, declared emperor 1897–1907)**

## 9. Notes on Scope and Method

- **Definition of “Emperor”:**  
  - Included: Roman (incl. Byzantine), Chinese, Japanese Tennō, Ottoman sultans (de facto emperors), Persian shahanshahs, Holy Roman emperors/kings of the Romans (where clear), and other recognized imperial titles.
- **Definition of “Assassinated”:**  
  - Intentionally killed by plotters (courtiers, military, rivals), including poisoning, strangling, murder during palace coups, or execution following a coup where the purpose was to remove the emperor.
  - Excluded (unless specifically flagged): Deaths in open battle, purely natural causes, clearly voluntary suicides not directly coerced by conspirators.
- **Uncertain cases:**  
  - Many deaths are recorded as “illness” but suspected poisoning. Those should be flagged as *disputed*.

## 10. To-Do / Expansion Plan

1. **Roman/Byzantine:**  
   - Build a complete table listing each emperor and explicitly tagging: assassinated / executed after coup / battle death / natural.
2. **Chinese dynasties:**  
   - For each dynasty (Qin, Han, Three Kingdoms, Jin, Northern/Southern dynasties, Sui, Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, Qing), identify emperors with strong scholarly consensus of assassination.
3. **Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Ethiopia, Mughal, Ottoman:**  
   - Systematically review succession narratives and mark clearly attested assassinations.
4. **Sources to consult:**  
   - Standard academic histories (Cambridge histories, Oxford handbooks, dynastic histories, peer-reviewed articles).
   - Cross-check with modern scholarly databases rather than only popular summaries.
