# Art Eras: From Luminism to Today

## Luminism (mid-19th century)
Luminism was an American landscape painting style emphasizing the effects of light and atmosphere. Artists focused on calm, often coastal or river scenes with smooth, almost invisible brushstrokes, clear skies, and tranquil water. The goal was to create a meditative, spiritual feeling through clarity of light and stillness.

## Impressionism (late 19th century)
Impressionism began in France and focused on capturing the fleeting effects of light, color, and atmosphere rather than precise detail. Artists painted outdoors (en plein air), using quick, visible brushstrokes and bright, unmixed colors. Everyday scenes—city streets, cafés, gardens—became worthy subjects.

## Post-Impressionism (late 19th to early 20th century)
Post-Impressionist artists built on Impressionism but sought more structure, emotion, or symbolism. Some emphasized bold color and expressive line (Van Gogh), others focused on geometric simplification (Cézanne) or decorative pattern and symbolism (Gauguin). The movement opened the door to more subjective and abstract approaches.

## Symbolism (late 19th century)
Symbolism turned away from realism and everyday life, focusing instead on dreams, myths, and inner states. Artists used symbolic imagery, rich color, and often mysterious, poetic scenes to suggest emotions, spiritual ideas, or psychological tensions rather than describe the visible world directly.

## Fauvism (early 20th century)
Fauvism, led by artists like Henri Matisse, used intense, non-naturalistic colors and simplified forms. Color was applied in broad, flat areas and chosen for emotional impact rather than realism. Though short-lived, it was crucial in freeing color from descriptive duties and moving toward abstraction.

## Expressionism (early 20th century)
Expressionism, especially strong in Germany and Northern Europe, focused on conveying emotional and psychological experience. Artists distorted forms, used harsh or unusual colors, and dynamic, sometimes violent brushwork to express anxiety, alienation, or spiritual longing in the modern world.

## Cubism (early 20th century)
Developed by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, Cubism broke objects and space into geometric planes and showed multiple viewpoints at once. It challenged traditional perspective and representation, laying a foundation for much of modern abstract art. Analytical Cubism fragmented form; Synthetic Cubism introduced collage and simpler shapes.

## Futurism (early 20th century)
Futurism, originating in Italy, celebrated speed, technology, and modern life—cars, machines, cities. Artists depicted motion through repeated forms, diagonal lines, and dynamic compositions. It embraced both the excitement and aggression of industrial modernity.

## Dada (1910s–1920s)
Dada was an anti-art movement born out of disillusionment with World War I. It rejected logic, tradition, and aesthetic rules, favoring absurdity, chance, and provocation. Collage, readymades (ordinary objects presented as art), and performances questioned what art is and what value it has.

## Surrealism (1920s–1940s)
Surrealism explored the unconscious mind, dreams, and irrational associations, inspired by Freudian psychology. Artists combined realistic detail with impossible, dreamlike juxtapositions or used automatic drawing to bypass conscious control. The result was strange, poetic, and often unsettling imagery.

## Abstract Expressionism (1940s–1950s)
Centered in New York, Abstract Expressionism emphasized large-scale, non-representational paintings that conveyed emotion through gesture, color, and surface. Action painters like Jackson Pollock dripped and flung paint, while color field painters like Mark Rothko used large areas of color to evoke contemplative moods. It marked America’s rise as a center of the art world.

## Pop Art (1950s–1960s)
Pop Art drew imagery from mass culture—advertising, comics, consumer goods, celebrities. Artists like Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein used bright colors, repetition, and commercial techniques to blur the line between high art and popular culture, both celebrating and critiquing consumer society.

## Minimalism (1960s–1970s)
Minimalism reduced art to simple geometric forms, industrial materials, and repeated structures. The focus shifted from personal expression to the viewer’s direct, physical experience of objects and space. Works were often spare, cool, and precise, challenging ideas of what is necessary in art.

## Conceptual Art (1960s–1970s)
Conceptual Art prioritized ideas over visual form. The artwork could be a text, instruction, document, or simple object—the concept itself was the main art. This movement questioned the role of the art object, the artist, and institutions, influencing much of contemporary artistic practice.

## Postmodernism and Appropriation (1970s–1990s)
Postmodern art reacted against the grand narratives and purity of modernism. It embraced pluralism, irony, and mixing of styles. Appropriation artists borrowed and recontextualized existing images to question originality, authorship, and cultural power, often engaging with mass media and popular culture.

## Contemporary Art (1990s–today)
Contemporary art is diverse in style, medium, and theme. It includes installation, performance, digital and internet art, socially engaged practices, and more. Artists address global issues—identity, migration, technology, ecology, politics—often crossing boundaries between disciplines and cultures. Rather than a single dominant style, it is characterized by multiplicity and constant change.
